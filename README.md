# pack-gfx
This repository contains my personal GFX Pack, including logos, banners, wallpapers, and various graphic assets I designed myself.  
All the content was created for personal use and experimentation — I do this for fun, not for commercial purposes.

The file is too large to be hosted directly on GitHub, so you can download it here:

If I release a new version of the pack, all updates and changes will be documented in this repository.
